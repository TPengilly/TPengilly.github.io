<h1>Our goal is to provide any interesting or useful insights gained from the analysis of the beer and brewery data provided by Budweiser. In exploring the beer data we will analyze variables including ABV (alcohol content by volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), the brewer, brewery location, beer style, and the volume in ounces of the beer of interest in order to find interesting correlations. We have found numerous insights about beer preferences across the country and the differences between the various beer styles using both KNN and logistic regression classifiers. Our findings are presented below.</h1>

The top 10 states have some of the lowest excise taxes on beer nationwide, some of the largest 21 and older populations in the country, and some of the highest median incomes in the country. Others, like Colorado, have a long tradition of brewing, thanks to the gold rush and Coors, creating a peculiar brewing culture that exploded when home-brewing was legalized in 1979.</h1>

Kentucky craft beer is often aged in whiskey barrels, which can increase the ABV due to the residual whiskey, as well as allowing some water to evaporate.</h1>

<h1>A rough national median IBU rating is between 30-40, with Delaware having the highest (60), and West Virginia close behind at 57. Delaware and West Virginia are much higher than the rest of the nation because they have far fewer breweries than most states, but are following the national trend of brewing bitter IPA’s and pale ales. The median bitterness rating is much lower in the midwest than elsewhere in the country. This is due to the preference for ales over more bitter beer styles in this region.

<h1>The most noticeable trend is the popularity of ales in the midwest, and of IPAs on the west coast and in New England. It should be noted that the most brewed style by region is likely indicative of local preferences, since microbreweries tend to have smaller distribution zones than large brewers.

<h1>There were many valuable insights gained from the data provided by Budweiser. The distribution of breweries across the country is affected both by population demographics and the legal aspects of alcohol brewing and distribution. The strength of beers is also to some extent determined by law, and local preference, while the bitterness of local beers are determined almost wholly by local preference and new trends. These trends have been determined and summarized above, which can aid in targeted marketing for specific beers, or for consideration in creating new brews. A definite distinction was found between IPAs and ales, based solely on IBU rating. While IPAs tend to have a higher IBU rating than other ales, there is no such distinction in terms of alcohol content.</h1>
